        <h2 class="p">The Battle of Gods Arc</h2>
        <p class="content">Years after Majin Buu’s defeat, Earth enjoyed peace while Goku trained on King Kai’s planet. Far away, Beerus, the God of Destruction, awakened from his long slumber. Beerus’s role was to maintain balance by destroying worlds, but upon waking, he remembered a dream of a mighty warrior called the “Super Saiyan God.” Curious and restless, he set out with his attendant Whis to find this figure. His search brought him first to King Kai’s world, where he met Goku. Always eager for a challenge, Goku tested himself against Beerus, transforming up to Super Saiyan 3. To his shock, Beerus easily defeated him with just a flick and a light strike, showing a level of power far beyond anything Goku had faced.

        <br>
        Beerus then traveled to Earth, where Bulma was celebrating her birthday. Vegeta, remembering tales of Beerus’s terrifying strength, panicked but tried to keep the god entertained to protect everyone. For a while, the party went well—Beerus delighted in Earth’s food, especially pudding. But when Majin Buu selfishly refused to share his pudding cup, Beerus lost his temper. He effortlessly overpowered Earth’s strongest defenders, including Piccolo, Gohan, and even Vegeta. Just when hope seemed lost, Goku arrived and proposed using the ritual of the Super Saiyan God, revealed through Shenron.
        <br>
        <br>
        With the energy of five pure-hearted Saiyans—Vegeta, Gohan, Trunks, Goten, and the unborn Pan channeled through Videl—Goku transformed into a fiery red-haired Super Saiyan God. This godly form gave him divine ki, allowing him to battle Beerus on nearly equal terms. Their clash shook the Earth and even threatened the fabric of the universe itself. Beerus pushed Goku to his absolute limits, yet despite Goku’s growth and determination, he remained outmatched. Still, Beerus was impressed by Goku’s spirit and potential. Instead of destroying Earth, he declared the fight entertaining enough to spare the planet.
        <br>
        <br>
        Though defeated, Goku discovered a whole new realm of power and possibility. For the first time, the Z fighters realized that gods and beings far beyond their imagination existed. The battle marked the beginning of a new era, where Earth’s defenders would face not just powerful foes, but cosmic forces that shaped the universe itself.

      <h2 class="p">Resurrection ‘F’ Arc</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Not long after Beerus spared Earth, a new threat emerged from the stars. Frieza’s loyal soldiers gathered the Dragon Balls and resurrected their fallen emperor. Fueled by rage and humiliation from his defeat years ago, Frieza vowed to take revenge on Goku and the Saiyans. Knowing he was outclassed before, he spent months in intense training for the first time in his life, unlocking a fearsome new form: Golden Frieza. With this power, he launched an invasion of Earth, accompanied by his army.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Z fighters stood ready, but Frieza’s forces overwhelmed them with sheer numbers. Krillin, Piccolo, Tien, and Gohan fought bravely, but the real challenge came when Frieza himself entered the battlefield. Goku and Vegeta soon returned from their training with Whis, where they had unlocked Super Saiyan Blue—a form combining Super Saiyan strength with godly ki. Goku clashed with Golden Frieza, the two unleashing blasts that shook the planet. Frieza’s form was powerful, but his lack of stamina became clear. Goku began to gain the upper hand until a treacherous strike from Sorbet left him vulnerable.
            <br>
            <br>
            At that moment, Vegeta stepped in. Transforming into Super Saiyan Blue himself, the proud prince finally had his chance to finish Frieza once and for all. However, in a last act of spite, Frieza destroyed the Earth. Only Whis’s time-reversing ability prevented total disaster, rewinding events just enough for Goku to finish Frieza with a decisive Kamehameha. With Frieza gone again, Earth returned to peace, but the battles with gods and revived emperors reminded everyone that even greater challenges were on the horizon.

      <h2 class="p" style="width: 180px;">Universe 6 & Future Trunks Arcs</h2>
      <p class="content">
        The gods soon brought new trials. Beerus’s brother, Champa, proposed a Tournament of Destroyers between Universe 6 and Universe 7. Fighters like Cabba the Saiyan, Frost (Frieza’s counterpart), and Hit, the time-skipping assassin, challenged Goku and his friends. Though Goku pushed Hit to new levels, the match ended without a clear victory, showing that countless universes held warriors as strong—or stronger—than Earth’s defenders.
        <br>
        <br>
        Peace didn’t last long. Future Trunks returned, scarred by a dark new enemy: Goku Black. At first, the figure looked exactly like Goku, but his aura was sinister. He was later revealed as Zamasu, a Supreme Kai apprentice who stole Goku’s body in another timeline. With his philosophy of “Zero Mortals,” Zamasu joined forces with a version of himself, becoming fused into Fused Zamasu. This foe was so powerful that even Goku, Vegeta, and Trunks together struggled to match him. Future Trunks achieved a new transformation fueled by hope and rage, dealing a critical blow, but ultimately, the corruption of Zamasu consumed the timeline.
        <br>
        <br>
        In desperation, Goku summoned Zeno, the Omni-King, a childlike god who ruled all existence. With a wave of his hand, Zeno erased the entire corrupted timeline, ending Zamasu’s reign of terror. Trunks’s world was lost, but he departed for another future timeline with Mai. The arc revealed just how dangerous divine power could be and introduced the terrifying authority of Zeno himself.

      <h2 class="p" style="width: 180px;">Tournament of Power Arc</h2>
      <p class="content">
        The events with Zamasu inspired Zeno to organize a multiversal tournament: the Tournament of Power. Universes with low mortal rankings would battle in a battle royale, and those defeated would face erasure. Goku assembled a team of ten warriors from Universe 7: Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo, Android 17, Android 18, Frieza, Krillin, Tien, Master Roshi, and himself. Each universe brought champions, including Jiren, the stoic powerhouse from Universe 11’s Pride Troopers.
        <br>
        <br>
        The tournament was a survival brawl with warriors constantly being eliminated. Old heroes like Master Roshi showed their worth, while unexpected fighters like Android 17 became MVPs. The spotlight, however, fell on Goku, who unlocked Ultra Instinct—a divine state where his body moved without thought. With each clash against Jiren, Goku edged closer to mastery of this form. The final moments saw Goku, Frieza, and Android 17 team up against Jiren in a desperate push. Their teamwork succeeded, and Android 17 became the last man standing.
        <br>
        <br>
        Granted one wish with the Super Dragon Balls, Android 17 selflessly wished for all erased universes to be restored. His act of compassion impressed even the gods. Universe 7’s survival wasn’t just a victory of strength but also of spirit.

      <h2 class="p">Broly & Moro Arcs</h2>
      <p class="content">
        After the tournament, Goku and Vegeta encountered a new Saiyan: Broly. Raised in isolation and manipulated by his father, Broly’s latent power knew no limits. When Frieza manipulated events to unleash him against Goku and Vegeta, the two Saiyans faced an opponent who grew stronger with every strike. Despite fusing into Gogeta through the Potara dance, it took everything they had to stop Broly. Recognizing his pure heart, Goku spared him, even offering friendship.
        <br>
        <br>
        Later, in the manga’s Galactic Patrol Prisoner saga, the ancient sorcerer Moro escaped captivity. Unlike past foes, Moro could absorb life energy from planets and fighters alike. His army ravaged galaxies, and even Goku and Vegeta’s new powers seemed insufficient. Vegeta sought training on Planet Yardrat, learning Spirit Fission to counter Moro’s absorption, while Goku pushed to perfect Ultra Instinct. In the final confrontation, Goku mastered the technique, allowing him to fight with unmatched calm and precision. With aid from allies, he defeated Moro before the villain could consume Earth itself.
        <br>
        <br>
        These arcs cemented Dragon Ball Super’s themes: the endless pursuit of strength, the bonds of friendship, and the responsibility that comes with power. From battling gods to saving universes, Goku and his friends had grown into protectors not just of Earth but of reality itself, with more adventures surely awaiting them.
